    <p>The concept of “Shelter” is for viewers to view this virtual space as a planetarium. From pitch black to slowly putting pieces together to create a new world where humans can explore the world of planet space. I was inspired by the idea of merging sustainability and science fiction. I thought of how the world would look like if humans were aliens living in space. Would they be sustainable despite living in a world where there is a single tree alive? In addition with a single tree stranded on an island  and crumpled papers to show the reproduction of endless papers that’s been consumed/produced. This work targets my curiosity of space art intersecting with the outer and inner space, as well as tackling the idea of sustainability in science fiction. The viewer is free to navigate and explore the environment, this creates an interactive immersive experience to allow further understanding of our sense in relation to our physical reality. 
The javascript I used are three.module.js, stats.module.js, lil-gui.module.min.js, GLTFLoader.js, TrackballControls.js.
